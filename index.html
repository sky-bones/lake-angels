<div class="icon">

<p>the angels arrive when the dawn lake-fog does.
They walk out of the water with their fishbelly-white
skins painted in mud runes and wearing halos of
green glass shards and fishing wire. their fingers
look like curls of sycamore bark. They kiss me with
damp mouths and my heart starts to overflow
with clamshell songs. </p>
